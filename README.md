# Shalidors Library

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,react,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

A project inspired by The Elder Scrolls online to display guides to players looking for the information they need.
This project originally started as a way for me to expand my knowledge in React with an engaging subject. After a certain point I decided to share this into my GitHub repository as it will show over time how I challenge features and updates over a period of time, and introducing new Librarys to shape how the project looks.

* All files are included in the project and will be complete over time. I planned a structure and flow to help myself stay on track for an MVP on the project.

# What have I learned during this?

* Making large API's from scratch, thinking about the long term consiquences, shape, and usability of the data I was piecing together. Only data that would be used made it's wau into the project.
* Presenting large amounts of data into readable tables.
* Introducing search functions into the pages displaying the data to allow users to find information they are looking for
